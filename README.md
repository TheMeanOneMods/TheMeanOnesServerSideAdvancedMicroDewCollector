TheMeanOnes ServerSide Advanced Micro Dew Collector is a compact, high-performance survival tool designed for ultimate utility in challenging environments. This modlet introduces a smaller, more efficient dew collector that is locked behind later progression, ensuring balanced gameplay while rewarding dedicated players.


# Key Features:
Compact Design: Unlike the vanilla dew collector, which is large and bulky, the TM1 Advanced Micro Dew Collector is a sleek 1x1 block, making it perfect for tight spaces in survival bases.
Improved Efficiency:
Faster Conversion Times: Produces water in just 3–5 in-game hours, significantly faster than the vanilla version's 6–10 hours.
Higher Output: Each cycle yields up to 50 jars of water, ensuring you stay hydrated longer. 150 Jar Maximum! 
Lower Heatmap: Designed with stealth in mind, this collector generates minimal heat (HeatMapStrength = 1.5), reducing the chance of attracting unwanted zombie attention. Much less than its vanilla, beginner counterpart.
# Progression-Based Unlock:
Requires the Crafting Workstations skill in the progression tree.
Unlockable at level 30, ensuring it's accessible only to players who have invested time and effort into advancing their skills.
Can be crafted once unlocked, making it a reward for long-term planning and resource management. Crafting recipe is slightly different and requires some new things such as LegendaryParts.
# Visual and Functional Enhancements:
Custom purple tint and unique barrel model for a visually distinct look.
Smaller block size ensures seamless integration into any base layout. (Its so compact!)
Special crafting progression ensures it aligns with mid-to-late-game survival strategies for those who like myself - tend to run out of space quick!
Survival-Oriented Gameplay: With its faster water production and higher output, this dew collector is a must-have for any survivalist aiming to thrive in harsh environments.
# Conclusion:
TheMeanOnes Advanced Micro Dew Collector is the ultimate survival workstation, combining practicality, aesthetic appeal, and balanced progression.
